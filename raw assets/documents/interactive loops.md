# Interactive loops

As told by Michael Seller's ["Advanced Game Design"](https://www.informit.com/store/advanced-game-design-a-systems-approach-9780134667607) book, we want to be mindful of these different interaction loops.

For this game jam, it might be best to have most focus on the short-term cognitive interaction loop. Meaning the player turn.

## Action/Feedback
This is when the players move their pawn, and every other tiny interaction like a button click. Also casting the dice

## Short-term Cognitive
The player turn. We want the player to be mindful of their choices, and given enough time and pause to make their decision.

Perhaps highlighting available pawns and upon selection where they are available to be moved.

The player turn consists of:
1. rolling the dice
2. moving a pawn

## Long-term Cognitive
This is perhaps when the player defeats a pawn (by moving to their opponents exact location) and also winning the game.
Both of these needs to be highlighted with their appropriate effects.

## Social
Perhaps we could entice some rivalry between the two players?
Some sort of label that says something when a player is ahead, or something?

## Emotional
We've yet do determine what kind of emotion we're going for at this stage.
Some sort of triumph when one player wins?

## Cultural
Making a slow interaction loop about the fact that this game is a libgdx game jam? I'm not sure.
