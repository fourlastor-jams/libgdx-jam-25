# Core Loop
## Description
The game of Ur playes like a turn based two player board game.
The game starts, giving the turn to player (p1), they make their turn and it then goes to player 2 (p2) and so on in a cycle, until one of them wins.

This is a rough sketch of the loop:

A player moves their pawn, then gives the turn to the other player, and so on until one of them wins.

## Goals
The goal is to create a player versus feeling and tension, where the two have to outsmart eachother and better their chances to win.
